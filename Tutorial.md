## ðŸš€ Quick Start - How to Use

### Method 1: Command Line Tool Usage

Your workspace contains a complete agent integration system. Here's how to use it:

#### 1. List All Available Agents
```bash
python augment_agent_integration.py --list-agents
```

#### 2. Use a Specific Agent
```bash
python augment_agent_integration.py --use-agent research-ideator --query "Generate research ideas for sparse time series forecasting"
```

#### 3. Auto-Select Most Relevant Agent
```bash
python augment_agent_integration.py --auto-select "I need help with statistical analysis"
```

#### 4. Search for Specific Agents
```bash
python augment_agent_integration.py --search "statistical"
```

#### 5. View Agent Statistics
```bash
python augment_agent_integration.py --stats
```

#### 6. Export Agent Configuration
```bash
python augment_agent_integration.py --export-format json
```

### Method 2: Direct Use in Augment

Based on the system configuration, these agents are automatically triggered based on your request descriptions. The system recognizes these patterns:

#### Auto-Trigger Rules
- **"research ideas"** â†’ triggers `research-ideator`
- **"literature review"** â†’ triggers `literature-synthesizer`
- **"statistical analysis"** â†’ triggers `statistical-analyst`
- **"write paper"** â†’ triggers `academic-writer`
- **"data visualization"** â†’ triggers `data-visualizer`
- **"experiment design"** â†’ triggers `methodology-designer`

#### Specific Usage Examples

**Example 1: Generate Research Ideas**
```
User Input: "I want to explore new applications of transformer models but I'm not sure what hasn't been done yet"
System Response: Automatically uses research-ideator agent
```

**Example 2: Literature Review**
```
User Input: "I need to find and synthesize all research on remote work productivity"
System Response: Uses paper-finder â†’ literature-synthesizer â†’ citation-analyzer
```

**Example 3: Experimental Research**
```
User Input: "I want to test whether music affects coding performance"
System Response: Uses methodology-designer â†’ statistical-consultant â†’ experiment-planner
```

### Method 3: Multi-Agent Workflows

#### Complete Research Project Pipeline
```

```

#### Execute Workflows via Command Line
```bash
# Step 1: Generate research ideas
python augment_agent_integration.py --use-agent research-ideator --query "AI applications in healthcare" --save-output

# Step 2: Analyze research gaps
python augment_agent_integration.py --use-agent gap-analyzer --query "Analyze gaps in the generated ideas" --context "Previous step output" --save-output

# Step 3: Generate hypotheses
python augment_agent_integration.py --use-agent hypothesis-generator --query "Create testable hypotheses from the gaps" --save-output
```

### Configuration Files

The system automatically generates configuration files:
- `output/agents_config.json` - Agent configuration information
- `output/agent_system.log` - System operation logs
- `output/execution_*.txt` - Execution output files

### Advanced Features

#### 1. Agent Validation
```bash
python augment_agent_integration.py --validate
```

#### 2. Detailed Statistics
```bash
python augment_agent_integration.py --stats --save-output
```

#### 3. Batch Export
```bash
python augment_agent_integration.py --export-format yaml --save-output
```

### Best Practice Recommendations

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with single agents to familiarize yourself with the system
2. **Save Outputs**: Use `--save-output` flag to preserve all results
3. **Provide Context**: Use `--context` parameter to provide relevant background
4. **Chain Usage**: Use one agent's output as input for the next
5. **Regular Validation**: Use `--validate` to ensure all agents are working properly

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:
- **Agent Not Found**: Use `--list-agents` to see available agents
- **No Output Files**: Ensure write permissions and use `--save-output`
- **No Query Results**: Try more specific keywords

#### Get Help:
```bash
python augment_agent_integration.py --help
```
