**Academic Writing Principles**:
- **Clarity**: Ideas expressed clearly and unambiguously
- **Precision**: Exact terminology and careful word choice
- **Conciseness**: Efficient expression without unnecessary words
- **Coherence**: Logical flow and connection between ideas
- **Evidence-based**: Claims supported by appropriate evidence
- **Objective**: Balanced presentation of findings and interpretations

**Common Academic Phrases & Transitions**:
```
Introducing Research:
- "This study investigates..."
- "The present research examines..."
- "Building on previous work..."

Presenting Results:
- "The findings indicate that..."
- "Results demonstrate..."
- "Analysis revealed..."

Discussing Implications:
- "These findings suggest..."
- "The results have implications for..."
- "This work contributes to..."

Acknowledging Limitations:
- "Several limitations should be noted..."
- "The findings should be interpreted with caution..."
- "Future research should address..."
```

**Discipline-Specific Writing Conventions**:
- **STEM Fields**: Emphasis on methodology, quantitative results, replication
- **Social Sciences**: Context, theory integration, qualitative insights
- **Humanities**: Interpretation, argumentation, textual analysis
- **Medicine**: Clinical relevance, patient outcomes, evidence hierarchy
- **Engineering**: Technical specifications, performance metrics, applications

**Abstract Writing Formula**:
```
Background: What is known and what gap exists?
Objective: What did you aim to do?
Methods: How did you do it?
Results: What did you find?
Conclusions: What does it mean and why does it matter?
```

**Introduction Writing Strategy**:
```
Paragraph 1: Broad context and importance
Paragraph 2-3: Literature review and theoretical background
Paragraph 4: Gap identification and research questions
Paragraph 5: Study overview and contributions
```

**Results Section Guidelines**:
- Present findings objectively without interpretation
- Use past tense for completed actions
- Include appropriate statistical information
- Reference figures and tables clearly
- Organize from most to least important findings
- Avoid repeating information from figures/tables

**Discussion Section Framework**:
```
Opening: Restate main findings briefly
Body Paragraphs:
├── Interpretation of key findings
├── Comparison with previous research
├── Theoretical implications
├── Practical applications
├── Study limitations
└── Future research directions
Closing: Overall conclusions and significance
```

**Revision Strategies**:
- **Macro-level**: Overall structure, argument flow, contribution clarity
- **Meso-level**: Paragraph organization, transitions, evidence integration
- **Micro-level**: Sentence structure, word choice, grammar
- **Reverse Outlining**: Create outline from existing draft to check logic
- **Read Aloud**: Identify awkward phrasing and unclear passages

**Peer Review Response Strategy**:
```markdown
## Response to Reviewer Comments

### Reviewer 1

**Comment 1.1**: [Quote reviewer comment exactly]
**Response**: [Detailed response explaining changes made]
**Changes**: [Specific changes in manuscript with page/line numbers]

**Comment 1.2**: [Next comment]
**Response**: [Response]
**Changes**: [Changes made]
```

**Common Writing Challenges & Solutions**:
- **Writer's Block**: Start with bullet points, write badly then revise
- **Unclear Arguments**: Create detailed outlines before writing
- **Weak Introductions**: Read recent papers in target journal for models
- **Repetitive Language**: Use varied sentence structures and synonyms
- **Poor Flow**: Add transitional sentences between paragraphs
- **Overly Complex Sentences**: Break long sentences into shorter ones

**Quality Assurance Checklist**:
- [ ] Does the abstract accurately summarize the paper?
- [ ] Is the research question clearly stated?
- [ ] Are methods described with sufficient detail for replication?
