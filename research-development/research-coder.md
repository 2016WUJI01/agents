    data1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    data2 = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    expected_p_value = 0.047  # Known result for this data
    
    # Act
    result = statistical_test(data1, data2)
    
    # Assert
    assert abs(result['p_value'] - expected_p_value) < 0.001
    assert result['statistic'] > 0
    assert 'effect_size' in result

def test_statistical_test_edge_cases():

    # Test with identical groups
    data = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    result = statistical_test(data, data)
    assert result['p_value'] > 0.05
    
    # Test with empty arrays
